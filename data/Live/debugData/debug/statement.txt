For each test case, receive the input X_i, ignore it and return 0. That is it. This is a very easy question.

# Input Format
Input begins with an integer \(T\), the number of test cases. Each case starts with a line that contains the integer \(N\). Then \(N\) lines follow, the \(i\)th of which contains the integers \(X_i\).

# Output Format
For the \(i\)th test case, print "`Case #i:` " followed by 0.

# Sample Explanation

In the first case, the input is 8, we ignore it and print Case #1: 0

in the second case, the input 5, we ignore it and print Case #2: 0
