  # Tags
  Tag the above competitive coding problem with 7 tags that would allow you to find similar problems. Prepend each tag with a weight. The sum of all tag weights should add up to 1.
  Tags should focus on the problem not the solution and include any uncommon datastructures, rules or constraints required by the problem. Tags should be made generic enough to match other competitive coding problems and use computer science terms.
  -----
  Important:
  
  Do not include explanation. Do not include competitive_coding or any variation as a tag. You must output in the following format:
  
  weight: tag
  
  Here is an example of a good set of 7 tags:

  0.20: collision_handling
  0.20: energy_transfer
  0.15: greedy_simulation
  0.15: linear_traversal
  0.10: positional_indexing
  0.10: tie_breaking
  0.10: nearest_target
