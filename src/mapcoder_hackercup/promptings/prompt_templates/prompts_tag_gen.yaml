  Tag the above competitive coding problem with 5 detailed tags that would allow you to find similar problems. Prepend each tag with a weight. The sum of all tag weights should add up to 1. Tags should focus on the problem not the solution
  -----
  Important:
  
  Do not include explanation. Do not include competitive_coding or any variation as a tag. You must output in the following format:
  
  weight: tag
  
  Here is an example of a good set of 5 tags:
  
  0.30: collision_dynamics
  0.25: energy_transfer
  0.20: 1d_motion
  0.15: closest_to_target
  0.10: unique_initial_conditions
