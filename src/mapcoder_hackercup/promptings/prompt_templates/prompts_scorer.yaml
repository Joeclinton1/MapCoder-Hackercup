scorer: |
  Given the below competitive coding problem:
  
  ```
  {problem_prompt}
  ```
  
  Write a python lambda function score predicted test case outputs, against provided true outputs. It should take the predicted output and a hardcoded sample output and score it.
  
  For example, if a test case output uses floats that are correct if they are within 10^-6 absolute error of the true sample output we would use the following scorer:
  
  ```python
  lambda pred,true: round(float(true), 6) == round(float(pred), 6)
  ```
  
  if the predicted test case just needs to match and is not an inequality or approximation, it suffices to leave the outputs in string form and check if they match:
  
  ```python
  lambda pred,true: pred == true
  ```
  
  If the question allows for approximations the scorer should use chained inequality expressions, and convert to float or int.
  
  Output just the solver lambda function in python code do not include any explanations or reasoning. It must use the exact format as described above.
