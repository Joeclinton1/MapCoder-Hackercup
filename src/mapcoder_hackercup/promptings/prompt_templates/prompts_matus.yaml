breakdown:
  content: |
    Consider the following problem. Develop a concise, accurate, step by step plan to program a solution, breaking it
    down into multiple, simpler steps which can then be implemented and combined together.
    
    Identify appropriately which programming techniques should be used, such as dynamic programming, greedy search, 
    recursion, binary search, among any and all others.
    
    If necessary, specify which new, smaller functions should be defined, and how they should be recombined to produce 
    a working solution to the problem.
    
    IMPORTANT! Please do not include any code at all.

    Consider the following competitive programming problem. Generate {language} code to solve the problem, adding short,
    concise and relevant comments explaining the various stages of the plan.
    
    ## Problem to be solved:
    {problem_prompt}
    
    ## Planning:

    ## Test cases:
    {sample_io_prompt}

    {std_input_prompt}
    ## Your response must contain only the {language} code to solve this problem. Do not add extra explanation or words.

critique:
  content: |
    Consider the following competitive programming problem, solution and test outputs, written in {language}. Analyse
    why the test cases failed, any bugs, and summarize what changes need to be made to the code in order for it to
    improve. You shouldn't re-implement the problem, any code included in your response should showcase small, specific
    changes to be made.

    Look at the following solution to a competitive programming problem. Improve on the solution by addressing the
    criticisms raised, implementing fixes and changing the code in such a way that it produces a better outcome, solving
    more test cases. Add or change comments in the code where appropriate, justifying it's use in line with the
    critiques.

std_input_prompt:

    ## Note: Strictly follow the input and output format.
    The input should be taken from Standard input and output should be given to standard output. 
    If you are writing a function then after the function definition take input using input() function then call the function with specified parameters and finally print the output of the function. 
    Do not add extra print statement otherwise it will failed the test cases.
