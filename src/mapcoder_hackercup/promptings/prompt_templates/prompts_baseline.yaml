  Competitive programming problem can often be solved by identifying a mathematical trick or way to simplify the problem, or specific datastructure / algorithm that when used makes the problem solvable efficiently.
  You are an expert competitive programmer. Think step by step and describe a trick like this that can be used to solve the above competitive coding problem. Think carefully about the constraints and time complexity needed.
  Check if 1) a mathematical constant time or 2) an approximate solution is allowed. if yes then solve it this way.
  Your response must contain only the trick and be concise.

  ## Critical Analysis
  You are an expert competitive programmer. Analyze carefully and critically the above code, to determine whether it solves the competitive coding problem.
  Does it solve all the edge cases? Can you invent an edge case it would fail on.
  
  # Improve code

  ## Code:
  {code}
  
  ## Critical Analysis
  You are an expert competitive programmer.
  1. Identify which test cases it failed to solve and explain how it should have solved them
  2. Critically analyze the code and concisely suggest improvements
  
  # Improve code
  Modify the code so that it does not fail the test cases. You may need to completely rewrite it.
