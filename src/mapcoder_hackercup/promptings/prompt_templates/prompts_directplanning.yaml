    ----------------
    Important:
    Your response must follow the following xml format-
    
    <root>
    <planning>
    # Provide {mapping_k} correct, efficient and varied pseudocode plannings to solve the problem mentioned above. Write each pseudocode planning in the following format.
    <pseudocode>
    # Pseudocode planning to solve this problem.
    </pseudocode>
    </planning>
