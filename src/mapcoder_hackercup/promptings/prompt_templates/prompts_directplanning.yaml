    Given the below problem, provide {mapping_k} correct and efficient pseudocode plannings to solving the competitive coding problem.
    # Problem to be solved:
    {problem_prompt}
    {sample_io_prompt}
    
    # Plannings
    Provide, {mapping_k} correct and efficient pseudocode plannings to solving the competitive coding problem,
    
    # Algorithm:
    
    ----------------
    Important:
    Your response must follow the following xml format-
    
    <root>
    <planning>
    # Provide {mapping_k} correct, efficient and varied pseudocode plannings to solve the problem mentioned above. Write each pseudocode planning in the following format.
    <pseudocode>
    # Pseudocode planning to solve this problem.
    </pseudocode>
    </planning>

    # similarly add more plannings here...

    <algorithm>
    # Identify the overall algorithm (Brute-force, Dynamic Programming, Divide-and-conquer, Greedy, Backtracking, Recursive, Binary search, and so on) that needs to be used to solve the original problem.
    # Write a useful tutorial about the above mentioned algorithms. Provide a high level generic tutorial for solving these types of problems. Do not generate code.
    </algorithm>
