To solve the problem, the key tricks are:

Optimal Pairing: Always have the two slowest travelers cross together while the fastest traveler returns with the flashlight, minimizing the time spent on return trips.
Chauffeur Strategy: Designate the fastest traveler as the one who always carries the flashlight and wheelbarrow, making all return trips.
Time Calculation: Use a formula to compute the total crossing time based on the crossing times of the fastest and second-fastest travelers, ensuring it does not exceed the allowed time K.
Edge Case: For a single traveler, simply check if their crossing time is less than or equal to K.
